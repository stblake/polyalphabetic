# End-to-end test: solve a Playfair cipher (-type playfair) and verify the recovered
# plaintext byte-for-byte against playfair_pride.solution.
#
# The 976-character ciphertext was enciphered with the keyword KRYPTOSABCDEF over the
# 25-letter alphabet (J merged into I). Playfair is genuinely near the limit of a
# quadgram attack on short texts, so this uses a long message, a fixed seed, the
# AZDecrypt-style log-probability scoring (-logprob), and the tuned anneal schedule.
# Playfair grids are unique only up to cyclic row/column rotation, but every such grid
# decrypts identically, so the recovered PLAINTEXT is what we check.
