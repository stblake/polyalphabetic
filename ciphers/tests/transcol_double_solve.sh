# End-to-end test: solve a DOUBLE columnar transposition (-type transcol2).
# transcol_double.txt was produced by two stacked columnar stages: stage 1 wrote
# the plaintext into 7 columns (read top-to-bottom, keyed), then stage 2 wrote
# that into 9 columns (read top-to-bottom, keyed). The solver randomises (K1,K2)
# over -mincols..-maxcols each restart and anneals both column orders. Double
# columnar is inherently harder and stochastic — raise -nrestarts / -nhillclimbs
# if it does not converge. It should recover transcol_solution.txt.
