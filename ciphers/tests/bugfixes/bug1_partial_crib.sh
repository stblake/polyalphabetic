# Bug 1: the trailing partial-crib match row used to index the positionally-packed
# crib_indices array (and test it against an uninitialized -1), printing garbage
# digits/'*' at EVERY position. The fix indexes the crib by cipher position via
# cribtext_str ('_' = no crib).
#
# bug1_cipher.txt is "ITISATRUTH...NEIGHBOURHOOD" enciphered with Vigenere key
# KRYPTOS (len 7). bug1_crib.txt reveals UNIVERSALLY, FORTUNE and NEIGHBOURHOOD.
# When solved, the partial-crib row should read all 0s (exact match) under each
# crib word and '_' everywhere else -- perfectly aligned with the crib line above.
