# Bug 2: the -transmatrix '>>>' one-line summary, in the NO-dictionary branch,
# printed trans_period/trans_offset (the -transperoffset fields, here stale)
# instead of trans_w1/trans_w2/trans_clockwise. The dictionary branch was fine.
#
# The no-dictionary branch only fires when OxfordEnglishWords.txt is NOT auto-
# loaded, so this runs the binary from a scratch dir that lacks it. We pass
# -transmatrix 7 11 cw; the summary must now show "7, 11, 1" (w1, w2, cw),
# not the old stale "<period>, <offset>".
