# Bug 4: a cipher/ngram/crib path longer than MAX_FILENAME_LEN overflowed the
# fixed char[] in ColossusConfig (main() strcpy's the CLI arg in unbounded),
# corrupting the config struct and crashing with SIGILL ("Illegal instruction").
# This bit any absolute path past the old 100-byte limit; it was first hit by the
# transposition test scripts, which pass absolute paths.
#
# Fix: MAX_FILENAME_LEN raised to 4096. This test passes a deliberately long
# (>100 char) absolute path and asserts the solver runs and emits its '>>>'
# summary instead of crashing.
