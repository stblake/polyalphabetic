# columnar solver (-type transcol). The ciphertext transcol_single_tb.txt was
# produced by writing the plaintext row-wise into 9 columns and reading the
# columns out top-to-bottom in a keyed order (incomplete final row). The solver
# does not know the column count or order; it sweeps -mincols..-maxcols and
# hill-climbs the column-order permutation. It should recover transcol_solution.txt.
# Stochastic — raise -nrestarts / -nhillclimbs for a harder cipher.
