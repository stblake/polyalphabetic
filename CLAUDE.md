Guidance for working in this repository.

## Scope

This directory is the **entire project** and the git root. It tracks
`https://github.com/stblake/colossus` (branch `main`). Everything outside this
directory is out of scope — git can't see it, and neither should you. (The parent
folder holds unrelated experiment runs, logs, and candidate dumps; ignore it.)

## What this is

Colossus is a polyalphabetic substitution cipher solver in C by Sam Blake (started 14 July 2023).
It attacks **Vigenère, Gronsfeld, Beaufort, Porta, Quagmire I–IV, Autokey, and Progressive
Key** ciphers (plus
their variants and Beaufort/Porta autokey tableaus), optionally composed with a
transposition stage. The engine is a **stochastic, slippery, shotgun-restarted hill
climber with backtracking**. Cipher conventions follow the American Cryptogram
Association (https://www.cryptogram.org/resource-area/cipher-types/). It exists to
crack the Kryptos sculpture's K1–K4. See `README.md` for the author's full writeup.

## Layout (sources under `src/<cipher-class>/`)

The C sources are grouped by cipher class under `src/`; everything else (build,
tests, tools, data, ciphers) stays at the repo root. All local `#include`s are
**flat** (`#include "foo.h"`, no directory prefix) — the makefile resolves them
with one `-I` per `src/` subdir (the `INCLUDES` variable), so a header is found
regardless of which subdirectory it lives in. Add a new `src/` subdir → add it
to `INCLUDES`.

## Build

```bash
make            # gcc -Wall -O3; builds ./colossus
make clean
```

Two caveats:
- The active `CC` line does **not** include `-lm`. Links on macOS (clang folds libm
  into libc) but fails on Linux — add `-lm` there.
- `make` also runs `cp colossus ..` (and `../quagmire`), copying the binary
  *outside* this directory. That predates the isolation of this repo; the in-tree
  `./colossus` is the one that matters here.
- The translation-unit list lives in makefile variables, each path prefixed with the
  source-class dir vars (`$(CORE)`, `$(POLY)`, `$(TRANS)`, `$(GRAPH)`, `$(SUBST)`):
  `PRIMITIVES` (the cipher decrypt math + utils), `SOLVERS` (the engine/scoring/trans_common
  core + the per-cipher-type solver modules), and
  `SOLVER_SRC = $(PRIMITIVES) $(SOLVERS) $(CORE)/colossus.c` (used by both `all` and the
  `testopt` harnesses). Every compile also passes `$(INCLUDES)` (one `-I` per `src/` subdir).
  Add a new solver module to `SOLVERS` with its `src/<class>/` prefix.

`make test` builds and runs the framework-free unit tests in
`tests/test_transpositions.c` (the transposition primitives, including the columnar
`decrypt_columnar`: known-answer, round-trip across complete/incomplete grids and both
read directions, double-columnar composition), `tests/test_ciphers.c`,
`tests/test_optimal_cycleword.c`, and `tests/test_playfair.c` (the Playfair primitives:
the Wikipedia known-answer vector, the prepare/X-insertion rules, encrypt/decrypt
round-trips over random grids, and the cyclic row/column key-square equivalence), and
`tests/test_bifid.c` (the Bifid primitives: the Wikipedia known-answer vector, the keyed-
square build, encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random 5x5 and 6x6 squares × random
lengths/periods incl. incomplete blocks, and the period-1 identity), and
`tests/test_trifid.c` (the Trifid primitives: the Wikipedia known-answer vector — two
groups, AIDET→FMJFV and OILEC→OISSU, over the 27-symbol cube — the keyed-cube build,
encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random 3x3x3 cubes and side-generic 2x2x2/4x4x4 cubes ×
random lengths/periods incl. incomplete blocks, and the period-1 identity), and
`tests/test_hill.c` (the Hill primitives: the Wikipedia known-answer vector — key
GYBNQKURP, ACT→POH and CAT→FIN — the modular inverse over all residues mod 26, the
matrix inverse by M·inv==I and inv(inv)==M plus singular rejection, encrypt/decrypt
round-trips over random invertible keys for block sizes k=2..5 × random lengths incl.
non-multiples of k, and the k=1 edge cases), and
`tests/test_gronsfeld.c` (the Gronsfeld primitives: a known-answer vector pinning the
numeric-key convention — HELLOWORLD + key 12345 → IGOPTXQUPI — plus the zero-shift
identity and mod-26 wrap, encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random digit keys × random
lengths, exact agreement with `vigenere_*` fed the same digits as its cycleword, and the
keylen-1 / over-long-key edge cases), and
`tests/test_phillips.c` (the Phillips primitives: the full ACA `DIAGONALS` worked-example
known-answer vector — the 81-letter `squares one…is forty` → `KZWLY…GREYXO` — plus an
assertion pinning `phillips_build_squares`' 8-square Row table cell-for-cell against the
ACA's printed squares #1–#8, encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random base squares × random
lengths for ALL THREE variants and a side-generic 6x6, and the documented structural facts
— the column-rotation symmetry, its row-rotation dual, the #1≡#5 / #2≡#8 cyclic equivalences,
and that the 8 derived squares are distinct grids), and
`tests/test_twosquare.c` (the Two-Square primitives: the ACA worked-example known-answer
vector for the horizontal type — the two printed squares, `anothe…px` → `IRRTEHMKGIMEQGRUNMMZSV`
— and the Wikipedia worked-example for the vertical type — EXAMPLE/KEYWORD → `HEDLXW…` — plus
encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random squares × random lengths for BOTH arrangements and a
side-generic 6x6, the vertical type asserted SELF-INVERSE, and the documented transparencies
asserted directly — horizontal same-row → reversed pair, vertical same-column → unchanged), and
`tests/test_foursquare.c` (the Four-Square primitives: the Wikipedia worked-example known-answer
vector — keyed squares EXAMPLE/KEYWORD over the fixed standard squares, `HELP…` → `FYGMKY…` —
encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random keyed squares × random lengths and a side-generic 6x6,
and a degenerate identity-square check pinning the exact coordinate algebra), and
`tests/test_adfgvx.c` (the ADFGVX/ADFGX primitives: a HAND-COMPUTED known-answer vector pinning
the whole convention end to end — identity 5x5 square, `ATTACK` + keyword `KEY` → `AGADAGAFGGAX`
— the label tables, the K=1 (identity-columnar) edge case, and encrypt/decrypt round-trips over
random squares × random column counts × random lengths incl. ragged grids and both read
directions, for both the 5x5 (ADFGX) and the side-generic 6x6 (ADFGVX, 36 cells) squares), and
`tests/test_nihilist_sub.c` (the Nihilist Substitution primitives: a HAND-COMPUTED known-answer
vector pinning ALL THREE conventions at once on the same plaintext/key/square — identity 5x5,
`ZAEZ` + key `ZK` → carry `110 36 70 80` / no-carry `0 36 60 70` / mod-100 `10 36 70 80`, the
carry-triggering positions making the conventions diverge so a mix-up is caught — the validity
predicate asserted vs the legal set, and per-convention stress: encrypt/decrypt round-trips over
random squares × keys × lengths × periods (incl. p=1, p>len, incomplete), a keyed-label round-trip
that also asserts the label-keyed cipher equals the relabelled fixed-label cipher, and a
side-generic 6x6), and
`tests/test_gromark.c` (the Gromark / Periodic Gromark primitives: the TWO ACA worked-example
known-answer vectors pinned cell-for-cell — keyword `ENIGMA`, basic primer `23452`,
`thereare…` → `NFYCK…`, and periodic period-6 `wintry…` → `RHNAAX…` — the K2M mixed-alphabet builder
(`ENIGMA` → `AJRXEBKSYGFPVIDOUMHQWNCLTZ`), the chain-addition rule for P=5 and P=6, the periodic
primer/offset derivation pinned (ranks `264351`, offsets `4 21 13 9 17 0`), encrypt/decrypt round-
trips over random alphabets × primers × lengths for both variants, the identity-alphabet reduction
to a pure chain-shift, and periodic-with-zero-offsets == basic), and
`tests/test_nicodemus.c` (the Nicodemus primitives: a HAND-COMPUTED known-answer vector pinning all
three substitution conventions at once on the same plaintext/keyword — `ATTACKATDAWN`, keyword `KEY`,
H=2 → VIG `XGKKRIXAKKBL` / VARIANT `PYQQVMPSQQFP` / BEAU `LCKKFOLIKKVL` — `nicodemus_key_from_keyword`
(shifts + stable-argsort order incl. repeated keyword letters), encrypt/decrypt round-trips over
random orders/shifts × lengths × P × block heights — incl. ragged final blocks, H=1 and the
single-block degenerate — for all three variants, and agreement of the per-column substitution with
`vigenere_decrypt`/`beaufort_decrypt` fed the same shift as a length-1 cycleword), and
`tests/test_bazeries.c` (the Bazeries primitives: the ACA worked-example known-answer vector pinning
the whole convention end to end — plaintext `simplesubstitution…`, `N=3752` → ciphertext `ACYYU…GQGCI`,
the spelled-out keyed square `THREOUSANDVFIYWBCGKLMPQXZ`, the digits `3,7,5,2`, and the intermediate
reversed-groups string `missbuselp…` — the column-major pt vs row-major ct substitution convention
(identity-square check + fsub/invsub mutual inverse), the transposition asserted an involution over
random digit patterns, encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random N × lengths (incl. the 150–250 band),
and edge cases — a 0 digit, a 1-digit key, ragged final groups), and
`tests/test_portax.c` (the Portax primitives: the ACA worked-example known-answer vectors — the
mini pairs `IN→JL`/`NO→UA`/`NA→DB` (key U/V) and `TA→NM`/`BG→QH` (key E, same-column), plus the
keyword `EASY` end-to-end `THEEARLYBIRDGETSTHEWORMX → NIJAMPBGQCWKHQJEUIKYMPAT` — the pair operation
asserted an involution over all (s, a, b), the self-reciprocal `decrypt == encrypt` and the
shift/key-letter forms agreeing over random keys × lengths, per-column independence, a ragged final
block (lone top letters pass through), and edge cases — `P=1`, `P>len`, a single pair), and
`tests/test_progkey.c` (the Progressive Key primitives: the ACA worked-example known-answer vector —
Vigenère, key `GRAPEFRUIT`, P=10, prog=1, `THISCIPHERCANBEUSEDWITHANYOFTH → ZYIHGNGBMKJSORJAKZMQQMJRTFHBDC`
with the per-group drift A,B,C — encrypt/decrypt round-trips over random keyword × prog × length ×
period for all three bases (incl. ragged final group, P=1, over-long key), agreement of
`progkey_encrypt` with an INDEPENDENT two-pass reference built from `vigenere_*`/`beaufort_*` (keyword
pass then a full-length drift-key pass), the prog=0 degeneration to a plain periodic Vigenère/Variant,
and `progkey_deprogress` inverting the drift pass exactly).
`make testopt` additionally runs the in-process solver regressions
`tests/test_solver.c` (polyalphabetic), `tests/test_playfair_solver.c` (Playfair:

cliff showing recovery from ~200 characters),
`tests/test_twosquare_solver.c` (Two-Square: registry validation for both arrangements plus a
non-registry type left untouched, a ~900-char capability floor — horizontal through the

extra-thorough additions: a transparency-rate measurement (~20% same-row digraphs) and a
multi-keyword sweep reporting mean/worst recovery), and
`tests/test_foursquare_solver.c` (Four-Square: registry validation, a ~900-char capability

`tests/test_adfgvx_solver.c` (ADFGX/ADFGVX: registry validation for both types plus a
non-registry type left untouched; an ADFGX capability floor with the column count K pinned;
a BLIND K-selection test — K swept, the solver must report the true K, exercising the IoC
decoupling term; an ADFGX length cliff; an ADFGX multi-keyword sweep (mean/worst); and an

the reward-only quadgram table — no `-logprob` needed; recovers cleanly from very short text since the
de-progressed columns are a pure Vigenère).
`ciphers/tests/` additionally holds
end-to-end cases (ciphertext + `*_solution.txt`, plus `*_solve.sh` runners — e.g. the
`transcol_*_solve.sh` columnar recovery tests and `playfair_solve.sh`) you can run by hand.

`ciphers/tests/run_tests.sh` is the **accuracy regression suite**: a manifest of
59 end-to-end cases (Vigenère, Gronsfeld, Beaufort, Porta, Quagmire I–IV, autokey, the ACA
`q*_p1xx` puzzles, pure-transposition types, a homophonic substitution, a Playfair
cipher, a Bifid cipher, a Trifid cipher, a Hill cipher, the three Phillips
variants — Row / Column / Row-Column — a Two-Square (horizontal + vertical), a
Four-Square cipher, an ADFGX cipher (`adfgx_decl`, K pinned), the Nihilist
Substitution family (carry / no-carry / mod-100, plus a keyed-label cipher solved as a
relabelled square), a Gromark (`gromark_decl`, blind) + Periodic Gromark
(`gromark_periodic_decl`, blind, period swept), the three Nicodemus variants
(`nicodemus_decl` / `nicodemus_variant_decl` / `nicodemus_beaufort_decl`, P/H pinned), a
Bazeries cipher (`bazeries_decl`, digit count pinned), a Portax cipher (`portax_decl`, period
pinned), and the three Progressive Key bases (`progkey_decl` / `progkey_var_decl` /
`progkey_beau_decl`, period + progression pinned)) that each
solve to ~100% with a **fixed `-seed`** and quadgrams. It runs the solver, pulls the
recovered plaintext from the last field of the `>>>` CSV line, compares it
character-for-character to a sibling `<name>.solution` (bare A–Z plaintext), and prints
per-test accuracy + time + mean, exiting non-zero if any test drops below the threshold
(default 99%; the homophonic case lands ~99.9%). Because the seed is fixed, a
bit-identical refactor keeps every score at 100% and any behavioural regression shows up
immediately. Each test's `-nrestarts`/`-nhillclimbs` are trimmed to the smallest that
still lands on the solution at the seed, so the full run is ~2 min (was ~45 before
trimming). The manifest tags each case `fast` or `slow`:
`./run_tests.sh --fast` runs the 28-case fast tier in ~50s (use while iterating; incl. the three
~0s Progressive Key bases),
`--slow` the 29 heavier ciphers (incl. the ~24s Playfair, ~6s Bifid, ~18s Trifid, the
three ~13s Phillips solves, the two ~10s Two-Square solves, the ~17s Four-Square, the
~10s ADFGX, the four ~6–8s Nihilist Substitution solves, the three ~1s Nicodemus
solves, and the ~1s Bazeries solve), no flag runs both.
Add a case by appending a
`tier|name|type|cipher|args` line and running `./run_tests.sh --generate <name>`
once the recovered text is verified correct.

## Run

Run from this directory — the binary loads its n-gram table, dictionary, and
ciphertext from the current working directory.

```bash
./example.sh
# or, minimally:
./colossus -type q3 -cipher cipher.txt -ngramsize 4 -ngramfile english_quadgrams.txt
```

Required flags: `-type`, a cipher source (`-cipher <file>` or `-batch <file>`),
`-ngramsize`, and `-ngramfile`. Everything else has defaults (see `init_config`).
`-type` accepts aliases or integer codes: `vig`/`0`, `q1`..`q4`/`1`..`4`, `beau`/`5`,

`progkey`/`pk`/`56`, `progkey-var`/`pkv`/`57`, `progkey-beau`/`pkb`/`58`
(full list in `parse.c`; codes in `colossus.h`). Output is a human-readable block followed by a
`>>> ...` one-line CSV summary that batch runs grep/sort.

By default only the **first line** of the `-cipher` file is read (the rest is ignored,
e.g. a trailing `plaintext = ...` annotation). Pass **`-multiline`** to read the whole
file, dropping newlines so a ciphertext laid out over several lines (e.g. a homophonic
grid like Zodiac-408) is concatenated into one symbol stream.

**Tokenized symbol I/O.** Ciphertext is decoded by `decode_cipher()` (utils.c), not the
bare `ord()`. For every type except homophonic with no `-delimiter`, this is byte-for-byte
the historical per-character / 0..25-letter encoding (so the regression suite stays
bit-identical). For `homophonic` (or any type run with `-delimiter <char>`) it tokenizes
the input into a `SymbolTable` of distinct surface tokens and emits one **symbol id** per
position, so a ciphertext alphabet larger than A..Z -- comma-separated numbers
(`12,5,99,12`) or arbitrary ASCII symbols -- can be entered and displayed consistently
(`print_cipher()`). Default delimiter: auto (comma if the homophonic input contains one,
else per-character).

**`-logprob` (a.k.a. `-azdecrypt`).** Opt-in AZDecrypt / Practical-Cryptography n-gram
fitness: `load_ngrams` builds log10-probabilities with a floor that **penalises unseen
n-grams**, instead of the default reward-only normalized `log(1+count)` table (which
leaves unseen n-grams at 0). `ngram_score` keeps the score at scale 1 in this mode (a
mean log-probability). Default off => the table and every existing solve are unchanged.
Recommended with higher-order n-grams (e.g. `-ngramsize 5 -ngramfile english_quintgrams.txt`)
for hard substitution attacks; quintgrams take a homophonic solve from ~98% (quadgrams)
to ~100%.

Five **pure transposition** cipher types bypass the keyword/cycleword/period machinery
and are solved by optimization instead (all isolated from the polyalphabetic pipeline by
an early branch in `solve_cipher`):
- `transmatrix`/`transperoffset` → `solve_transposition()` +
  `shotgun_transposition_climber()`: optimize the transform's own small parameter vector
  (`transmatrix` → `w1,w2,direction`; `transperoffset` → `period d, offset n`) with the
  shotgun/slip hill climber and n-gram scoring.
- `transposition` → `solve_general_transposition()` + `shotgun_permutation_climber()`: an
  AZDecrypt-style solver that hill-climbs the **full permutation key** (`decrypted[i] =
  cipher[key[i]]`). Restarts are seeded from columnar layouts; a periodic-redundancy
  structure term (`key_structure_score`, weight `-weightstructure`, default 4) guards
  against n-gram-gaming; simulated-annealing acceptance; and a period-targeted column-swap
  move reorders whole columns. Stochastic — run more restarts/iterations for hard ciphers.
- `transcol`/`transcol2` → `solve_columnar()` + `shotgun_columnar_climber()`: a
  **dedicated columnar** solver that, unlike the general one, optimizes only the small
  per-stage **column-order permutation** (length `K` = column count) via the
  `decrypt_columnar()` primitive (`transpositions.c`). Single (`transcol`) sweeps the
  column count over `-mincols..-maxcols` (default 2..30); double (`transcol2`) randomises
  `(K1,K2)` per restart and anneals both keys. Read direction is opt-in via
  `-readdir tb|bt|both` (default `tb`); incomplete final rows are handled automatically.
  No structure-score guard is needed — every candidate is a genuine columnar layout. Move
  set is column swaps (dominant) + short reverses/block-moves with the same Metropolis
  annealing as the permutation climber.

These `-type` values are distinct from the `-transmatrix`/`-transperoffset` *post-decrypt
stage* flags, which apply a fixed, user-supplied transposition after a polyalphabetic solve.

**Three additional transposition solvers** (added from the W168 toolkit review; see
`COLOSSUS_ADDITIONS.md`) extend the columnar family. All preserve spaces/periods as grid
cells and are isolated by their own early branch in `solve_cipher`:
- `transcol-l`/`coltrack`/`41` → `solve_columnar_track()` (`columnar_track_solver.c`): a
  **columnar with a within-column row permutation `L`** (the jarl / "dave transposition"
  scheme). The engine anneals the column order under the cheap **identity-L** reading (the
  within-row n-grams discriminate the order); the exact best `L` is recovered **once at
  report** via the Held-Karp **seam decomposition** (`seam_best_row_order`, `trans_common.c`)
  -- nesting best-L per eval is both slower and worse (it flattens the column-order contrast).
  Needs a complete grid (`len % K == 0`) for best-L; a ragged grid degrades to a plain
  columnar. Sweeps `K` over `-mincols..-maxcols`, optionally crossed with `-readdir` (column
  dir) and `-readrowdir lr|rl|both` (row dir, Rec 4). The reward-only quadgram table makes the
  seam ambiguous, so it effectively needs **`-logprob`** and/or the dictionary term.
  **`-cribanchored`** switches to a STRUCTURAL crib attack (a soft crib gives no gradient on a
  shallow many-column grid): the cipher's R-char blocks ARE the grid columns, a crib fixes some
  cells of each column, and a backtracking **block<->column matching** (most-constrained
  column first, n-gram + word-coverage tie-break) collapses the otherwise-intractable K-column
  search -- the only reliable attack on a shallow keyed columnar (assumes `L = identity`). This
  cracks all ten length-28 keyed columnars in `ciphers/W168/dave_tests/` from a 3-row crib
  (`ciphers/W168/dave_tests/solve_all.sh`, 10/10).
- `transroutecol`/`routecol`/`42` → `solve_route_chain()` (`route_chain_solver.c`): a two-stage
  **chain** -- a fixed geometric read-route global (`route_cells`, the 6 colossus routes)
  composed with a searched **column key**, read with the seam best-L. Sweeps the complete-grid
  rectangles and all routes; anneals the column key. Blind recovery is hard (the route adds a
  layer); best on short / favorable ciphers.
- `transtile`/`tile`/`43` → `solve_tile()` (`tile_solver.c`): a **sub-grid / tile
  transposition** -- every `h x w` tile of the grid is permuted by the same cell permutation
  (`-tile h w`, default 2x2), composed with a columnar column-order global. The engine
  **jointly** anneals the column order and the tile permutation; primitive `decrypt_tile`
  (`transpositions.c`). Complete grid only.

**Shared scoring additions (Rec 2, `dict.c`):** an optional `-weightword <f>` (default 0 =>
bit-identical) folds a length-weighted dictionary **word-coverage** reward into the
space-preserving transposition decrypt score (`word_set_build`/`word_coverage` + a fast hash
set); the same coverage breaks ties in the seam best-L. New raw additive n-gram sum
`ngram_sum_raw` (`scoring.c`) makes the seam decomposition exact. These are used only by the
new solvers; every existing solve is byte-for-byte unchanged. Note: `main()` no longer trims
trailing whitespace for the pure-transposition types (a trailing space is a real grid cell);
all existing transposition test ciphers are trailing-space free, so this is bit-identical.

The **homophonic** type (`solve_homophonic()`) is a `CipherModel` plugged into the shared
`run_solver()` engine just like every other type (`HOMOPHONIC_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`). Its
state is the many-to-one map `symbol_id -> plaintext letter` (carried in the `key` lane);
`decrypted[i] = key[cipher[i]]`. Unlike a 26->26 substitution (a bijection), a homophonic
map is free to fold many symbols onto E/T/A... to tile common n-grams -- a fixed point that
out-scores the true plaintext on raw n-grams. Two things prevent that collapse: (1) a
**monogram chi-squared penalty** on the decrypted letter distribution (`-weightmono`,
default 1.0), folded in via the decrypt hook's `score_adjust` and the greedy move; and (2) a
move set built around a **greedy coordinate step** (best plaintext letter for one symbol)
plus a **letter-class swap** (exchange the whole homophone classes of two letters, to cross
equal-frequency ambiguities like W<->M that single-symbol moves cannot). Seeds draw each
symbol's letter from the English monogram distribution. With quadgrams it recovers
~98%/~99%+ depending on homophone density; `-logprob` + quintgrams take it to ~100%.
Generate test ciphers with `tools/homophonic_gen.c` (`make homophonic_gen`).

The **Playfair** type (`solve_playfair()`, `PLAYFAIR_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is a
digraphic substitution over a **5x5 keyed grid** of 25 letters. The binary forces a
25-letter alphabet for `-type playfair` (J merged into I by ACA convention) via
`init_alphabet("J")` *before* `load_ngrams`, so the n-gram table is built over the same
25 letters (base-25 packing) and the grid is simply a permutation of `0..24` carried in
the `key` lane. The primitives live in `playfair.c` (`playfair_decrypt` is all the solver
needs; `encrypt`/`prepare`/`grid_from_keyword` serve the generator + unit tests). The
attack hill-climbs / anneals the grid with n-gram scoring (the classic SA Playfair
break): the move set is a single **cell swap** (dominant) plus **row/column swaps** and
**grid reflections** — the larger moves jump the local optima a cell swap can't escape;
cyclic row/column *rotations* are deliberately excluded (they re-encipher identically, so
the recovered grid is unique only up to such a rotation, but the recovered plaintext is
not). No anti-collapse penalty is needed (a grid is a bijection). Playfair is genuinely
near the limit of a quadgram attack: `-logprob` is effectively required, and recovery is
reliable from ~600+ characters and falls off a cliff below a few hundred (see
`tests/test_playfair_solver.c`, which prints the curve). Like every type it honours
`-method shotgun|anneal`; annealing is the default and far stronger here. Generate test
ciphers with `tools/playfair_gen.c` (`make playfair_gen`).

The **Bifid** type (`solve_bifid()`, `BIFID_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is Delastelle
fractionation over a **keyed Polybius square**: each letter splits into (row, col)
coordinates, the block's rows-then-cols coordinate stream is re-paired into ciphertext
letters, and the block size is the **period**. It defaults to the same 5x5, 25-letter,
J->I square as Playfair (`init_alphabet("J")` before `load_ngrams`), with the square a
permutation of `0..24` in the `key` lane; the primitives (`bifid.c`) are **side-generic**
(`side`/`n = side*side` parameters) so a 6x6 (36-cell) square works once a 36-letter
alphabet is active. The square attack is identical to Playfair's (cell-swap-dominated
anneal + row/column swaps and reflections, no anti-collapse penalty — a square is a
bijection). The extra dimension is the period: `bifid_estimate_periods()` ranks trial
periods by the **columnar Index of Coincidence** (the existing `mean_ioc()`), which peaks
at the true period because each within-block position becomes a coordinate-pure column.
The IoC also peaks at *multiples* of the true period, so the true period is not always
rank 1 — but it is reliably in the top-K, and the solver anneals the top `-nperiods` (default
5) candidates as separate engine configs and lets the n-gram score pick the winner (a wrong
period decrypts to gibberish). `-period N` pins a single period; `-maxperiod` bounds the
estimator's scan (default `min(20, len/2)`). Like Playfair it effectively needs `-logprob`
and recovers reliably from ~350+ characters (see `tests/test_bifid_solver.c`, which prints
the period-estimator hit rate and the length cliff). Generate test ciphers with
`tools/bifid_gen.c` (`make bifid_gen`).

The **Trifid** type (`solve_trifid()`, `TRIFID_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is Bifid lifted
into **three dimensions**: each letter splits into (layer, row, col) coordinates over a
**keyed 3x3x3 cube**, the block's layers-then-rows-then-cols coordinate stream is re-
grouped into consecutive *triples* that index new cube cells, and the block size is the
**period**. A 3x3x3 cube has **27 cells**, one more than the 26-letter alphabet, so Trifid
runs on a **27-symbol alphabet — A..Z plus a 27th symbol `+`** (`init_alphabet_trifid()`
before `load_ngrams`; the cube is a permutation of `0..26` in the `key` lane). This is the
one type whose runtime alphabet `g_alpha` exceeds 26: `ALPHABET_SIZE` (26) stays the
hardcoded mod base of the polyalphabetic primitives, and a separate `MAX_ALPHABET_SIZE`
(27) sizes only the runtime alphabet maps (`g_idx_to_char_arr`, `g_monograms`) and the
ciphertext-facing IoC scratch — everything indexable by a live symbol id. The `+` decodes
because `ord()`/`char_to_index()` consult `g_char_to_idx` for any registered ASCII char,
not just letters (bit-identical for A..Z input). The primitives (`trifid.c`) are
**side-generic** (`side`/`n = side^3`). The cube attack is the same anneal as Bifid/Playfair
(cell-swap-dominated + structured plane-swap/reflection moves along the cube's three axes,
no anti-collapse penalty — a cube is a bijection). The period is recovered exactly as
Bifid's (`trifid_estimate_periods()` over `mean_ioc()`, top-`-nperiods` annealed). Like
Bifid it effectively needs `-logprob` and recovers reliably from ~450+ characters (see
`tests/test_trifid_solver.c`). Generate test ciphers with `tools/trifid_gen.c`
(`make trifid_gen`).

The **Hill** type (`solve_hill()`, `HILL_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is a **polygraphic
substitution**: a block of `k` plaintext letters (a column vector) is multiplied by a
`k×k` key matrix **mod 26**, so it runs on the **full 26-letter alphabet unchanged**
(`ALPHABET_SIZE` is already the mod base — no `init_alphabet` forcing). The crucial design
choice: the state carried in the `key` lane **is the decryption matrix `D`**, applied
straight to the ciphertext (`plain = D·cipher mod 26`), so the hot path never inverts a
matrix; the true plaintext came from an invertible encryption key `K`, so the climb
converges on `D = K⁻¹`, and the matrix is inverted **only at report time**
(`hill_mat_inverse`, via a cofactor determinant + adjugate) to display the recovered
encryption key. The block size `k` has no IoC-style estimator, so the solver simply
**sweeps `k = 2..5`** (one engine config each, `-period` pins one; `cipher_len >= 2*k`
required) and the n-gram score picks the winner — a wrong `k` decrypts to gibberish. The
attack is a matrix anneal: ~85% change one element to a different random value (the
dominant fine move), ~10% randomize a whole row, ~5% add a random multiple of one row to
another mod 26 (a coarse jump). **A singular decryption matrix (det not coprime to 26) is
penalised** (`HILL_SINGULAR_PENALTY`, via the decrypt hook's `score_adjust`): unlike
Playfair/Bifid/Trifid a Hill matrix is a bijection *only* when invertible, and a singular
one folds the ciphertext onto a sub-lattice, decrypting to a low-entropy repetitive string
(the zero matrix → all `A`s) that out-scores real plaintext on n-grams and would otherwise
attract the climb into a collapse. Like the other near-the-limit types it effectively needs
`-logprob`. **The
search lever is restarts, not iterations**: the matrices are small (k=2 is only 26⁴ keys),
greedy climbs converge fast, and the landscape is rugged, so the schedule favours **many
short restarts**. k=2 and k=3 are reliably breakable ciphertext-only; k≥4 is exercised
only by the primitive round-trip/inverse tests (`tests/test_hill.c`), not asserted as a
ciphertext-only solve (`tests/test_hill_solver.c` characterizes the k=2/k=3 capability).
The primitives (`hill.c`) are **generic in `k`** (the determinant/inverse use cofactor
expansion, fine for `k <= HILL_MAX_K = 5`). Generate test ciphers with `tools/hill_gen.c`
(`make hill_gen`).

The **Gronsfeld** type (`gronsfeld`/`gron`/`34`) is a **Vigenère cipher with a numeric
key**: the per-column shift is a key digit `0..9` (`C = P + d`, `P = C − d`, mod 26), so
it is exactly Vigenère restricted to the 10 smallest shifts. Unlike Hill/Bifid/… it is
**not** a separate `CipherModel` — it is a type *inside* the shared `POLYALPHA_MODEL`
(`polyalpha_solver.c`), wired to behave like `VIGENERE` (straight pt/ct alphabets, only the
cycleword is searched) with one change: the **cycleword/shift domain is bounded to `0..9`**
(`GRONSFELD_DIGITS`) in the seed, perturb, and — crucially — the `derive_optimal_cycleword`
column search (`smax` in `optimal_cycleword.c`). So it reuses the whole polyalpha pipeline
(IoC period estimation, the deterministic optimal-cycleword frequency attack, crib
handling); the digit bound is a strong prior that makes recovery faster and reliable from
shorter text than an unconstrained Vigenère solve. The cycleword *is* the key, so the
decrypt path calls a tight direct primitive (`gronsfeld_decrypt`, `gronsfeld.c`) rather
than the Quagmire indirection, and the report prints the recovered key as digits. It rides
the polyalphabetic search defaults (no registry entry) and the default reward-only quadgram
table (no `-logprob` needed, like Vigenère). Generate test ciphers with
`tools/gronsfeld_gen.c` (`make gronsfeld_gen`; the key arg is a digit string, e.g. `31415926`).

The **Phillips** type (`solve_phillips()`, `PHILLIPS_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is a **periodic
monographic substitution over 8 keyed Polybius squares** derived from one base 5x5 square. The
plaintext is split into blocks of 5 letters; block `b` is enciphered with square `(b mod 8)`,
each letter going to the one diagonally **down-right with wrap** (`cipher = sq[(r+1)%5][(c+1)%5]`),
so the overall period is 40. The 8 squares are derived from the base by a fixed row-reinsertion
table (squares 1–5: base row 0 reinserted at row positions 0–4; squares 6–8: then row 1 reinserted
at positions 1–3) — verified cell-for-cell against the ACA worked example. It runs on the same
25-letter (J→I) grid as Playfair/Bifid (`init_alphabet("J")` before `load_ngrams`), with the base
square a permutation of `0..24` in the `key` lane. The only unknown is that base square, so the
attack is **identical to Playfair's** (cell-swap-dominated anneal + row/column swaps and grid
reflections, no anti-collapse penalty — every derived square, and hence the whole map, is a
bijection) — but *monographic* (no digraph prep) and with **no period to estimate** (block size 5
and the 8-square cycle are fixed → a single engine config). Because it carries more signal per
character than digraphic Playfair, it recovers reliably from **~200+ characters** (see
`tests/test_phillips_solver.c`) and rides a leaner registry budget than Playfair (`4×250000`).
Like the other near-the-limit square types it effectively needs `-logprob`. The cyclic-column
rotation of the base re-enciphers identically, so the recovered square is unique only up to that
(the plaintext is unique). **Three variants** select how the 8 squares are built, all sharing the
solver/primitive: `phillips` (the ACA-standard **Row** type), `phillips-c` (**Column** — the same
reinsertion applied to columns), and `phillips-rc` (**Row-Column** — rows for squares 2–5, columns
for 6–8). The primitives (`phillips.c`) are **side-generic** (`2·side−2` squares of `side` letters).
Generate test ciphers with `tools/phillips_gen.c` (`make phillips_gen`; the variant arg is
`row`/`col`/`rowcol`).

The **Two-Square** (`solve_twosquare()`, `TWOSQUARE_MODEL`) and **Four-Square**
(`solve_foursquare()`, `FOURSQUARE_MODEL`) types are digraphic substitutions over **two keyed
5x5 squares** (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`). They run on the same 25-letter (J→I) grid as Playfair
(`init_alphabet("J")` before `load_ngrams`), but the state is a **pair** of squares packed
back-to-back in the `key` lane (sq1 = `key[0..24]`, sq2 = `key[25..49]`) — **50 cells, double
Playfair's**. For each plaintext digraph the two letters span a rectangle and the cipher pair is
the rectangle's other two corners (`twosquare.c` / `foursquare.c`; verified cell-for-cell against
the ACA Two-Square and Wikipedia Four-Square worked examples). The attack is the **same SA square
break as Playfair** — cell-swap-dominated moves plus row/column swaps and reflections, no
anti-collapse penalty (every square is a bijection) — but each move perturbs **one of the two
squares** (chosen uniformly) and there is **no period to estimate** (a single engine config). The
only prep is padding an odd plaintext with one `X` (no doubled-letter handling, unlike Playfair).
The larger 50-cell state needs more text and a bigger budget; like the other square types it
effectively needs `-logprob`. **Two-Square has two arrangements** sharing the solver/primitive,
selected by `cfg->cipher_type`: `twosquare` (the ACA **horizontal**, squares side by side — a
same-ROW digraph maps to the reversed pair) and `twosquare-v` (**vertical**, squares stacked — a
same-COLUMN digraph maps to itself, and the whole cipher is **self-inverse** so decrypt ==
encrypt). About **20% of digraphs are such transparencies**, a documented weakness that leaks
plaintext and makes Two-Square recover from short text. **Four-Square** keeps the upper-left and
lower-right squares as the **fixed standard alphabet** (`foursquare_standard_square()`); only the
upper-right (UR) and lower-left (LL) squares are keyed, and the two are independent — making it
the hardest of the family (its report breaks recovery down per-square: even cipher positions
decrypt through UR, odd through LL). The primitives are **side-generic** (`side`/`n = side*side`).
Generate test ciphers with `tools/twosquare_gen.c` / `tools/foursquare_gen.c`
(`make twosquare_gen foursquare_gen`; the Two-Square variant arg is `h`/`v`).

The **ADFGVX** (`adfgvx`/`adfg`/`45`) and **ADFGX** (`adfgx`/`44`) types (`solve_adfgvx()`,
`ADFGVX_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) are the classic WWI cipher: a **keyed Polybius-square
fractionation composed with a keyed columnar transposition** — the first
*fractionation-then-transposition* type, and the hardest of the polygraphic family because
the square and the column order must be recovered **jointly**. Each plaintext symbol becomes
its two cell coordinates, each a label from `{A,D,F,G,X}` (ADFGX, 5x5, 25 letters J→I) or
`{A,D,F,G,V,X}` (ADFGVX, 6x6, **36 symbols** A..Z + 0..9), so the ciphertext is **2N labels**
for an N-symbol plaintext; that 2N coordinate stream is then columnar-transposed under a
keyword of length K. ADFGX runs on the same 25-letter J→I alphabet as Playfair/Bifid;
ADFGVX forces a **36-symbol alphabet** (`init_alphabet_adfgvx()`, A..Z + digits, with the
digits at negligible monogram weight like the Trifid `+`), which is why `MAX_ALPHABET_SIZE`
is **36** (the largest runtime alphabet, sizing only the runtime alphabet maps + the IoC
scratch; the n-gram table is then base-36 — quadgrams 36⁴≈6.7M floats are fine, but **avoid
quintgrams** at base 36, ~240MB). The primitive (`adfgvx.c`) works in **coordinate space**
(the solver maps the label characters to coordinates 0..side-1 up front) and is **side-generic**,
reusing `bifid_grid_from_keyword`/`bifid_build_inverse` for the square and the exposed
`decrypt_columnar` for the transposition stage — so it adds almost no new cipher math.
The state carries the square (`key[0..n-1]`, a permutation) **and** the column order
(`key[n..n+K-1]`); one engine config is enumerated per column count K in `-mincols..-maxcols`,
the square move set is Bifid's, the column-order move set the columnar solver's, and a move
perturbs one or the other. **The key to making the coupled search tractable** is a
**structural IoC reward folded into `score_adjust`**: after undoing the *correct* columnar
the paired cell ids are a monoalphabetic image of the plaintext, so the decrypt's Index of
Coincidence is English (~0.066) — and that IoC depends ONLY on the column order, not the
square (a square just relabels cells). The reward therefore gives the column-order search a
gradient independent of the square, decoupling the two halves (the climb locks the column
order by IoC, then the n-gram score recovers the square). Like the other near-the-limit
square types it effectively needs `-logprob`; ADFGX recovers reliably from ~200+ characters,
ADFGVX (the 36-cell square) needs more text and a bigger budget. Cribs are not used (the crib
positions are over the ciphertext, which is 2x the plaintext). Generate test ciphers with
`tools/adfgvx_gen.c` (`make adfgvx_gen`; args are a square keyword, a transposition keyword,
and `adfgx`/`adfgvx`).

The **Nihilist Substitution** family (`nihilist-sub`/`46`, `nihilist-sub-nc`/`47`,
`nihilist-sub-m100`/`48`; `solve_nihilist_sub()`, `NIHILIST_SUB_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is a
**periodic ADDITIVE** cipher over a keyed 5x5 Polybius square (25 letters, J→I, same alphabet as
Bifid). Each plaintext letter → its 2-digit coordinate **number** `rowlbl[row]*10+collbl[col]`
(fixed labels are `1..5`, so the legal set is `V = {11..15,21..25,…,51..55}`); a periodic additive
key (its own coordinate numbers) is added per position, so the ciphertext is a stream of decimal
**NUMBERS** (not letters) — `solve_nihilist_sub` parses them from the raw string itself (numbers
are space/comma/any-separated; not the per-character decode). **Three addition conventions** are
distinct `-type` codes sharing one primitive (`nihilist_sub.c`) + one solver, branched on
`cfg->cipher_type`: `nihilist-sub` (integer add **with carry**, ACA standard, cipher 22–110),
`nihilist-sub-nc` (per-digit add **mod 10, no carry**, cipher 00–99) and `nihilist-sub-m100` (2-digit
add **mod 100**). It is structurally the twin of ADFGVX — a COUPLED square + periodic-key search —
and uses the **same decoupling trick**: `pt_num = cipher_num − key_num` is INDEPENDENT of the
square, so the fraction of positions decrypting to a legal coordinate (the **validity** reward,
`NIH_VALID_WEIGHT * n_valid/n` folded into `score_adjust`) gives the additive-key search a gradient
flat in the square dimension — the climb locks the additive by validity, then the n-gram score
recovers the square (the additive cells live in `key[grid_size..]`, the square in `key[0..grid_size-1]`,
exactly like ADFGVX). The period is recovered by columnar IoC over the ciphertext **numbers**
(`nihilist_sub_estimate_periods`, top-`-nperiods` annealed; IoC also peaks at multiples, so a
multiple of the true period — with the keyword repeated — is an equally correct solve). Cribs are not
used (positions are over numbers, not plaintext). Like the other square types it effectively needs
`-logprob`; it recovers reliably from ~250+ characters. The primitive is **side-generic** and
**label-aware**: the standard fixed `1..5` labels can be replaced by a **keyed-label** permutation
(`-labels` in the generator) — but since a label permutation only permutes which cell gets which
number (leaving `V` unchanged), the labels are **not separately identifiable ciphertext-only**: they
fold into the recovered square, so the (fixed-label) solver cracks a label-keyed cipher as the
equivalent **relabelled square** (proven by the `nihilist_sub_kl` regression case). Generate test
ciphers with `tools/nihilist_sub_gen.c` (`make nihilist_sub_gen`; args are a square keyword, an
additive keyword, `carry`/`nc`/`m100`, and optional `-labels <rowkey> <colkey>`).

The **Gromark** (`gromark`/`gm`/`49`) and **Periodic Gromark** (`gromark-periodic`/`pgromark`/`50`)
types (`solve_gromark()`, `gromark.c` + `gromark_solver.c`) are the ACA "GROnsfeld with Mixed
Alphabet and Running Key" cipher (DUMBO 1969) and its periodic variant (1973). Both run on the
**full 26-letter alphabet** (no J-merge). A keyed cipher alphabet **σ** (a permutation of A..Z,
built by the **K2M transposition block** of a keyword — the simple keyed alphabet laid row-major at
keyword-width and read off by columns in heading-letter order) is composed with a **chain-addition
running key**: from a P-digit primer, `d[i]=primer[i]` for `i<P` and `d[i]=(d[i-P]+d[i-P+1]) mod 10`
otherwise (one digit per letter). **Basic Gromark** (5-digit primer): `C[i]=σ[(p[i]+d[i]) mod 26]`.
**Periodic Gromark**: the plaintext is split into consecutive groups of P (= the keyword length);
group `g` (cycling `mod P`) adds a per-group **offset** = the keyword letter's position in σ, so
`C[i]=σ[(p[i]+d[i]+offset[(i/P) mod P]) mod 26]`, and the primer is the keyword letters' alphabetical
ranks. The primitives (`gromark.c`) are hand-verified cell-for-cell against the two ACA worked
examples (keyword ENIGMA). **The two are attacked by DIFFERENT models** (both `SHAPE_ANNEAL`,
effectively need `-logprob`), because there is **no σ-independent decoupling reward** (the additive
shift sits inside the permutation σ, and chain addition amplifies a wrong primer digit into a
fully-wrong key, so naive joint annealing of (σ, primer) never accepts a primer move):
- **Basic Gromark** uses a **primer PRE-PASS** (the analog of `bifid_estimate_periods`): for each of
  the 10⁵ primers the running key is known, so recovering σ collapses to a monoalphabetic-
  substitution-with-known-per-position-shift — a 26×26 **max-weight assignment** (Hungarian) that
  picks σ to maximize an English monogram fit — and the primer is ranked by the n-gram score of the
  provisional decrypt. The top-K primers (length-adaptive, `-nprimers` overrides) become engine
  configs, each annealing σ from a random restart warm-started by the provisional σ; the n-gram
  score across configs picks the winner. Recovers reliably from ~120+ letters and reports the
  recovered primer.
- **Periodic Gromark** instead anneals the **KEYWORD directly** — its *entire* key is one keyword
  of P distinct letters (~28 bits), which derives σ, the primer, AND the offsets together, so
  treating those as independent unknowns blows a tiny key into an intractable coupled space the
  primer cannot be ranked in. The state is the keyword (`key[0..P-1]`); each decrypt rebuilds
  σ/primer/offsets via `gromark_build_from_keyword_idx`; one engine config per swept period P (like
  a fractionation period), no pre-pass. This is both far faster and far more reliable than a free-σ
  search (recovers ~150+ letters in seconds, reporting the recovered keyword). Cribs are not used.
  Generate test ciphers with `tools/gromark_gen.c` (`make gromark_gen`; args are a plaintext, a
  keyword, and a `<primer-digits>` for basic or the literal `periodic` for periodic).

The **Nicodemus** family (`nicodemus`/`51`, `nicodemus-variant`/`52`, `nicodemus-beaufort`/`53`;
`solve_nicodemus()`, `NICODEMUS_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is the ACA **substitution + transposition**
composite — the first such type besides ADFGVX, and the most plausibly K4-relevant (a masking
construction). A single **keyword** of length P drives two stages over blocks of **H rows × P
columns** (row-major fill, final block ragged; H is the ACA-standard 5 but swept here): (1) each
grid **column** is enciphered by its keyword letter — three ACA substitution conventions are
distinct `-type` codes sharing one primitive (`nicodemus.c`) + solver, `nicodemus` (Vigenère,
`C=P+k`), `nicodemus-variant` (`C=P−k`) and `nicodemus-beaufort` (`C=k−P`, reciprocal); (2) the
block's columns are read off top-to-bottom in the keyword's **alphabetical rank order** (a per-block
columnar transposition, the same incomplete-grid rule as `decrypt_columnar` but applied per H·P
block — its `K>len` guard would misfire on a final block narrower than P). Full 26-letter alphabet
(no J-merge); cribs are not used (the per-block transposition scrambles plaintext positions).
**The key to making the composite tractable** is the same decoupling the default `-optimalcycle`
path uses for the polyalphabetic ciphers: the annealed state is the **COLUMN ORDER alone** (a
permutation of `0..P-1` in `key[0..P-1]`, perturbed with the columnar `perm_move`/`perm_seed`), and
the P per-column **shifts are DERIVED deterministically** for each candidate order — after
de-transposing, grid-column `g = i % P` is a Caesar sample, and the shift maximising its monogram
fit against `g_monograms` is chosen (specialising `derive_optimal_cycleword`). Because every column
is fit to English *monograms* regardless of order, the **n-gram (quadgram) score drives the order**
search — cross-column digraphs only form at the true order — so it effectively needs `-logprob`.
Solving this general (order, shifts) form also cracks the ACA cipher (true key = the special case
`order == argsort(shifts)`); the recovered plaintext is what's checked. Note Vigenère and Variant
are **not separately identifiable** (a free derived shift absorbs the sign), so either solver cracks
a shift-substitution Nicodemus; only Beaufort (a reflection) is distinct. The period P **and** block
height H are **swept** — one engine config per `(P, H)` pair (`-period`/`-blockheight` pin them,
`-mincols`/`-maxcols`/`-maxblockheight` bound the sweep) — IoC period estimation is useless through
a transposition. It recovers reliably from ~120+ letters (P/H known) — see
`tests/test_nicodemus_solver.c`, which prints the length cliff and tunes the schedule. Generate test
ciphers with `tools/nicodemus_gen.c` (`make nicodemus_gen`; args are a plaintext, a keyword, a
`vig`/`variant`/`beau` substitution, and an optional block height).

The **Bazeries** type (`bazeries`/`baz`/`54`; `solve_bazeries()`, `BAZERIES_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`)
is the ACA **"simple substitution plus transposition"** cipher, keyed by ONE number **N < 1,000,000**
that drives BOTH stages over the 25-letter J→I alphabet (so `init_alphabet("J")` is forced before
`load_ngrams`, same as Playfair/Bifid). (1) **Transposition:** the plaintext is split into groups
whose sizes cycle through N's **decimal digits** (e.g. `3752` → 3,7,5,2,3,7,5,2,…) and each group is
**reversed** (an involution; a 0 digit is a zero-length group, skipped). (2) **Substitution:** a fixed
monoalphabetic map between two 5×5 squares — the PLAINTEXT square is the alphabet entered **column-major**
(fixed), the CIPHERTEXT square is **N spelled out** ("three thousand seven hundred fifty two") used as
the keyword of a keyed square entered **row-major** (so the square build reuses `bifid_grid_from_keyword`
/ `bifid_build_inverse`; the substitution is `pt_square[(r,c)] → ct_square[(r,c)]`). Encryption =
transpose then substitute; decryption = inverse-substitute then un-transpose. The primitive
(`bazeries.c`) is hand-verified cell-for-cell against the ACA worked example (`N=3752`, the square
`THREOUSANDVFIYW…`, ciphertext `ACYYU…`). **Because Colossus is optimisation-only and the whole key is
a number, the solver CLIMBS N's decimal digits rather than adding an exhaustive driver:** the state is
the D digit values (`key[0..D-1]`, leading digit 1..9), with **one engine config per digit count D in
1..6** (`-period` pins a single D; the union over D covers all of 1..999999). The rugged < 10⁶ digit
landscape is made navigable by a **square-quality monogram reward folded into `score_adjust`** (the
analog of ADFGVX's structural IoC term): the inverse substitution is monoalphabetic and a transposition
leaves the monogram multiset unchanged, so the decrypt's **mean English-monogram fit depends only on the
square (which N is spelled), not on the transposition digits** — rewarding it pulls the digit climb toward
the correct square, after which the n-gram score discriminates the exact number. Like the other square
types it effectively needs `-logprob`; **RESTARTS are the robustness lever** (each reseeds a fresh random
number), and it recovers reliably blind from ~150+ letters. Because the model also implements
`seed`/`perturb`/`copy`, `-method anneal|shotgun|pso` all run on it (calibrated in
`tests/test_bazeries_solver.c`). Cribs are not used (the transposition scrambles plaintext positions).
Generate test ciphers with `tools/bazeries_gen.c` (`make bazeries_gen`; args are a plaintext and the
number N).

The **Portax** type (`portax`/`ptx`/`55`; `solve_portax()`, `PORTAX_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is the
ACA **periodic DIGRAPHIC Porta** — the first digraphic polyalphabetic type. The plaintext is written
row-major into a block of width **P** (= keyword length) and rows are taken in **vertical PAIRS**
(rows 2g, 2g+1); the pair in column c — (top, bottom) — is enciphered **as a unit** over a Porta
**slide** keyed by `keyword[c]`, of which **only the Porta shift `key/2` (0..12) matters** (key
letters U and V are identical). The slide has a fixed upper half (A–M), a sliding upper half (N–Z),
and a two-row lower alphabet (even/odd letters); the two plaintext letters are diagonally opposite
corners of a rectangle whose **other two corners are the substitutes** (with a same-vertical-line
special case taking the other two cells of that line). The map is **self-reciprocal** (decrypt ==
encrypt). Full 26-letter alphabet (**no J→I merge**); the primitive (`portax.c`) is hand-verified
cell-for-cell against the ACA worked examples (key U/V `IN→JL`/`NO→UA`/`NA→DB`; key E `TA→NM`/`BG→QH`;
keyword `EASY`, `the early bird gets the worm` → `NIJAMPBGQCWKHQJEUIKYMPAT`). **The whole key is P
Porta shifts (a 13^P space)**, carried in the cycleword lane, with **one engine config per swept
period P** (IoC period estimation is useless through the digraphic pairing, so P is swept and the
n-gram score picks it — the rigid pairing makes a wrong P decrypt to gibberish; `-period` pins one,
`-mincols`/`-maxcols` bound the sweep). **The key to efficiency is per-column independence:** a
vertical pair is enciphered ENTIRELY by its column key, so every pair in column c decrypts from
`shift[c]` alone — the **per-column monogram-fit shift** (the analog of `derive_optimal_cycleword`)
**warm-starts the seed**, and the n-gram (quadgram) score then drives the anneal (cross-column
digraphs only form at the true shifts) and corrects any column the monogram fit mis-set. No
`score_adjust` is needed (every cycleword is a valid bijective decrypt). Unlike the other square /
fractionation types it **rides the reward-only quadgram table (no `-logprob`)**, like the rest of the
Porta family, and recovers reliably from **~70+ letters** (see `tests/test_portax_solver.c`). **Cribs
are supported** (the cipher is positional: `decrypted[i]` is plaintext position i). Because the model
implements `seed`/`perturb`/`copy`, `-method anneal|shotgun|pso` all run on it. Generate test ciphers
with `tools/portax_gen.c` (`make portax_gen`; args are a plaintext and a keyword).

The **Progressive Key** family (`progkey`/`pk`/`56`, `progkey-var`/`pkv`/`57`, `progkey-beau`/`pkb`/`58`;
`solve_progkey()`, `PROGKEY_MODEL`, `SHAPE_ANNEAL`) is the ACA **periodic key with a constant per-group
drift** — the first **non-stationary periodic key** type (a leading K4 hypothesis). The plaintext is
set in groups of **P** (= keyword length); a **primary** periodic encipherment of base type T under the
keyword yields `C1`, then a **second** encipherment **of the same type T** adds the **progressive key
letter** `Kp[g] = (g·prog) mod 26` per group `g = i/P` (the **progression index** `prog`: 1→A,B,C…,
2→A,C,E…). So the per-position shift is `keyword[i%P]` drifting by `(g·prog)`. **Three base types** are
distinct `-type` codes sharing one primitive (`progkey.c`) + solver, branched on `cfg->cipher_type`:
`progkey` (**Vigenère**, `C=P+k`), `progkey-var` (**Variant**, `C=P−k`) and `progkey-beau` (**Beaufort**,
`C=k−P`). Full 26-letter alphabet (**no J→I merge**); the primitive is hand-verified cell-for-cell
against the ACA worked example (Vigenère, key `GRAPEFRUIT`, P=10, prog=1, `thiscipher… → ZYIHG NGBMK
JSORJ AKZMQ QMJRT FHBDC…`). (`prog=0` is no drift — a plain periodic Vigenère/Variant; the Beaufort
group-0 pass is still a reflection, not identity.) **The whole key is P base shifts (0..25) plus the
progression**, carried in the cycleword lane. **IoC period estimation FAILS** (within a column each
group carries a different drifted shift, so columns are not monoalphabetic — like autokey), so the
**period is brute-forced** and the **progression enumerated 0..25**: one engine config per `(P, prog)`
pair (`cc->aux[0] = prog`; `-period`/`-cyclewordlen` pin P, `-progression` pins prog, `-mincols`/
`-maxcols` bound the period sweep). **The key to efficiency** is the same decoupling the polyalphabetic
`-optimalcycle` path uses: for a fixed `prog`, **DE-PROGRESSING** the ciphertext (undoing only the
drift pass via `progkey_deprogress`, leaving the primary base cipher `C1`) makes every column an
independent base sample under its own keyword shift — so the **per-column monogram-fit shift**
**warm-starts the seed**, and the n-gram (quadgram) score then drives the anneal AND, across all
`(P, prog)` configs, selects the true period and progression (a wrong P or prog leaves columns drifted
→ gibberish → low score). No `score_adjust` is needed (every cycleword is a valid bijective decrypt).
Unlike the square/fractionation types it **rides the reward-only quadgram table (no `-logprob`)**, like
the rest of the Vigenère family, and **recovers from very short text** (the de-progressed columns are a
pure Vigenère; see `tests/test_progkey_solver.c`). It is a **dedicated `CipherModel`, NOT inside
`POLYALPHA_MODEL`** (the engine's `engine_build_hist` keys per-column histograms on the raw cipher +
period, but progkey needs them on the de-progressed buffer, which depends on `prog` — so the solver
does its own per-column derivation, keeping the cipher-agnostic engine and shared `optimal_cycleword.c`
untouched). **Cribs are supported** (the cipher is positional: `decrypted[i]` is plaintext position i).
Because the model implements `seed`/`perturb`/`copy`, `-method anneal|shotgun|pso` all run on it.
Generate test ciphers with `tools/progkey_gen.c` (`make progkey_gen`; args are a plaintext, a keyword,
a progression index, and `vig`/`var`/`beau`).

**Per-cipher-type search schedules (`SearchDefaults`, `apply_cipher_defaults`).** The
`init_config()` globals (`inittemp 0.10`, `1x1000`, ...) suit the polyalphabetic /
transposition reward-score scale; a type whose score lives on a very different scale
needs its own schedule. A small compiled-in registry (`g_search_defaults[]` in
`colossus.c`) keyed by cipher type carries a tuned profile for **all three** search shapes
(anneal `a_*` + shotgun `s_*` + particle-swarm `p_*`; a zero `p_n_particles` means "no PSO
profile, keep globals"). `main()` pre-scans `-type`/`-method` and overlays the matching profile
*before* the main arg loop, so precedence is **globals < registry < explicit CLI flags**.
Types with no entry keep the global defaults bit-for-bit (so the regression suite is
unaffected) — currently Playfair (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `6x400000`, `inittemp 0.08`,
`backtrack 0.30`), Bifid (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `4x200000` per period, `inittemp 0.08`,
`backtrack 0.30`), Trifid (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `6x300000` per period, `inittemp 0.08`,
`backtrack 0.30` — a larger budget for the 27-cell cube), Hill (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`,
`250x8000` per swept block size, `inittemp 0.10`, `backtrack 0.25` — many short restarts,
since the small matrix climbs converge fast), Phillips and its two variants
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `4x250000`, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30` — a single config, leaner
than Playfair since monographic Phillips recovers from shorter text), Two-Square and its
vertical variant (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `8x600000`, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30`) and
Four-Square (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `12x700000` — the biggest budget, for its two independent
keyed squares), ADFGX (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `12x600000` per swept column count K) and ADFGVX
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `16x800000` per K — more, for the 36-cell square; both anneal at
`inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30`) have tuned entries (the two/four-square budgets are
larger than Playfair's for the 50-cell two-square state; the ADFGVX budgets are the largest,
for the coupled square+columnar search), the three Nihilist Substitution conventions
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `8x300000` per period, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30` — between Bifid and
ADFGX, for the coupled square+additive search), Gromark (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `3x120000` per top-K
primer config — a lean per-config 26-letter substitution anneal, since the primer pre-pass and the
provisional-σ warm start do most of the work) and Periodic Gromark (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `4x160000` per
swept period — the keyword anneal over a ~28-bit key; both at `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30`),
and the three Nicodemus codes (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `16x20000` per swept `(P, H)` pair, `inittemp 0.08`,
`backtrack 0.30` — many short restarts, since the climbed state is just a short column-order
permutation, so restarts are the robustness lever, not climbs), and Bazeries
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `40x20000` per swept digit count D, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30` — many
restarts, since the climbed state is a short digit string over a rugged < 10⁶ keyspace, so each
restart reseeds a fresh random number and restarts carry the robustness), and Portax
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `12x20000` per swept period P, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30` — a lean budget,
since the monogram-fit warm start gets most of the short per-column-shift state right on seed and
the anneal/n-gram pass only corrects a few columns), and the three Progressive Key bases
(`SHAPE_ANNEAL`, `3x2500` per swept `(P, prog)` pair, `inittemp 0.08`, `backtrack 0.30` — a very
lean per-config budget, since MANY `(P, prog)` configs are enumerated and the per-column monogram
warm start already gets most columns right, so a few short restarts suffice).
This is the mechanism for moving the magic
per-type budgets out of the run scripts and into the binary; add tuned entries for other
types incrementally. The registry is validated end-to-end in `tests/test_playfair_solver.c`.

**Optimisation methods (`-method`, cipher-agnostic).** The engine offers three search
methods, all driven by the *same* `run_solver`/`run_one_config` skeleton over the model
hooks — none of them know anything about the cipher representation:
- **Shotgun hill-climbing** (`SHAPE_SHOTGUN`): greedy uphill + accept-worse with a flat
  `slip_probability`; escape is external (many restarts + backtracking).
- **Simulated annealing** (`SHAPE_ANNEAL`): greedy uphill + Metropolis accept-worse
  `exp((Δ)/temp)` on a geometric `inittemp → mintemp` schedule. Each model declares its
  default shape; `-method shotgun|anneal` overrides it on every type.
- **Particle swarm** (`SHAPE_PSO`, `-method pso`): a memetic, **discrete swap-sequence**
  PSO in `run_one_config_pso` (`engine.c`). It is *only* reachable via `-method pso` (never
  a model's default), and is **completely cipher-agnostic**: a particle's position *is* a
  `SolverState`; "pull toward an attractor (pbest/gbest)" applies the model's own
  `perturb()` moves and keeps only those that reduce a generic Hamming distance over the raw
  state lanes (`state_distance`) — so a permutation stays a permutation, a keyword a keyword,
  a homophone map a map, with no per-cipher code. "Inertia" is a few random `perturb()`
  moves; each particle then does a short greedy local refinement (`-refine`) before its
  decrypt+score updates pbest/gbest. It reuses the budget knobs (`-nhillclimbs` = swarm
  iterations, `-nrestarts` = swarm relaunches) plus `-nparticles`/`-inertia`/`-cognitive`/
  `-social`/`-refine` (defaults in `init_config`; per-type `p_*` registry overrides). Works
  on **every** cipher type (verified end-to-end on polyalpha, square/period, and
  transposition lanes); whether it beats annealing on a given type is a tuning/benchmark
  question, not assumed. Because everything is gated behind `-method pso`, the
  `METHOD_DEFAULT` path — and the whole regression suite — stays byte-for-byte identical.

## How the solver works (mental model)

`solve_cipher()` (in `colossus.c`) is the pipeline:

1. **Period estimation.** For periodic ciphers, `estimate_cycleword_lengths`
   (`perioc.c`) picks candidate cycleword lengths via columnar IoC Z-scores. For
   **autokey** and **transposition-composed** ciphers IoC is useless, so it
   brute-forces lengths `1..max_cycleword_len`.
2. **Shotgun loop.** Nested loops over `(cycleword_len, pt_keyword_len, ct_keyword_len)`.
   Per-cipher-type rules constrain which `(j,k)` keyword-length pairs are valid (e.g.
   Vigenère/Beaufort/Porta force straight alphabets → length 1; Q3/A3 force `j==k`).
   These are the dense `if (...) continue;` blocks.
3. **`shotgun_hill_climber()`.** Random restarts, per-iteration keyword perturbation,
   optional slip (accept-worse to escape local maxima), and backtracking to best.
   Two cycleword strategies:
   - **`-optimalcycle` (default)**: the cycleword is *not* perturbed;
     `derive_optimal_cycleword()` solves each column's key char deterministically by
     maximizing the dot product of decrypted-column letter frequencies vs English
     monograms. Preferred for crib-free attacks.
   - **`-stochasticcycle`**: the cycleword is perturbed randomly like the keyword.
4. **Scoring** (`state_score`): n-gram log-prob is the backbone; with cribs it blends
   in a partial-match `crib_score`. `weight_ioc`/`weight_entropy` default to 0. The
   n-gram table itself has two modes (`load_ngrams`): the default reward-only normalized
   `log(1+count)` (unseen n-grams contribute 0), or, under `-logprob`, AZDecrypt-style
   log10-probabilities with an unseen-n-gram floor penalty (`g_ngram_logprob`).
5. **Reporting**: re-decrypts the best state, applies any transposition, counts
   dictionary words, prints results.

Text is carried internally as **0–25 integer index arrays**, not chars (`ord()` in,
`+ 'A'` out). A "keyword" is a 26-entry keyed-alphabet permutation; a "cycleword" is
the periodic key (sequence of shifts).

## Conventions & gotchas

- **Shared core header + thin per-module headers.** `colossus.h` is the shared
  *core*: the config/ctx/model structs, constants, cipher-type codes, globals, inline
  RNG, and the cipher-*primitive* prototypes (`vigenere_decrypt`, `decrypt_columnar`,
  `playfair_decrypt`, …) — every `.c` includes it. The cipher-agnostic core (`engine`,
  `scoring`, `trans_common`) and each per-cipher-type solver also get a *thin* `.h`
  exposing only that module's public API (`solve_<type>()`, the engine/scoring entry
  points); a `.c` includes the module headers it calls into. Put new solver prototypes
  in the module header, new shared structs/constants/primitive prototypes in `colossus.h`.
  (The already-split primitive files — `vigenere.c`, `beaufort.c`, … — keep their
  prototypes in `colossus.h` rather than carrying their own headers.)
- **`rng_state`** is a global in `utils.c`; the RNG (`fast_rand`, `frand`, `rand_int`,
  `rand_bounded`) is `static inline` in the header, seeded once in `main`. The
  `srand()` call in `main` is dead code — nothing uses libc `rand()`.
- **Stack-heavy.** `solve_cipher` and the hill climber declare several
  `MAX_CIPHER_LENGTH` (10000) int arrays on the stack, and there is **no bounds check**
  after `fscanf("%s", ...)`, so inputs must stay under the limit.
- **`-variant`** swaps decryption for encryption in the Quagmire/Vigenère math
  (reciprocal tableau). **`-samekey`** ties keyword and cycleword together.
- **Transposition is a post-decrypt stage**: `-transperoffset <offset> <period>` or
  `-transmatrix <w1> <w2> <cw|ccw>`. Crib positions are un-mapped back through it via
  `map_crib_to_cipher_pos` so cribs still line up.

## Fixed issues (end-to-end tests in `ciphers/tests/bugfixes/`)

- The trailing partial-crib match line (the `_`/digit/`*` row) used to index the
  packed `crib_indices` array positionally (testing an uninitialized `-1`), printing
  garbage at every position. Now indexed by cipher position via `cribtext_str`.
  Test: `bug1_partial_crib.sh`.
- The `-transmatrix` `>>>` summary (no-dictionary branch) printed period/offset
  instead of `w1`/`w2`/`clockwise`. Fixed to match the dictionary branch.
  Test: `bug2_transmatrix_summary.sh`.
- `load_ngrams` looped on `while(!feof(fp))`, re-reading the final line and
  mis-assigning a stale `freq` on any trailing/malformed line. Now loops on
  `fscanf(...) == 2`. Test: `bug3_ngram_load.sh`.
- A cipher/ngram/crib path longer than `MAX_FILENAME_LEN` overflowed the fixed
  `char[]` in `ColossusConfig` (`main()` `strcpy`s the CLI arg in unbounded),
  corrupting the struct and crashing with SIGILL — any absolute path past the old
  100-byte limit triggered it. `MAX_FILENAME_LEN` raised to 4096.
  Test: `bug4_long_path.sh`.
- `int_pow` did a final `base *= base` after the result was already accumulated;
  `int_pow(26, ngram_size)` overflowed signed `int` (e.g. `26^4` squared). The UB
  was benign at `-O0` but `-O3` could exploit it. Now skips the unused final squaring.

## Working agreements

- Match the existing style: 4-space indent, `snake_case`, integer-index text arrays,
  explicit per-cipher-type `switch`/`if` ladders. The code favors explicitness over
  abstraction — don't refactor the cipher-type dispatch into clever generic code.
- The binary `colossus`, `*.o`, and `.DS_Store` are git-ignored.
- Don't commit or push unless asked.
